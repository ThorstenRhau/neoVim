# My NeoVim setup

This setup is "by me for me", intended for my personal use.

## Dependencies

```
brew install ripgrep fd cmake git node wget shellcheck eslint python3 selene
```

```
npm install -g neovim
```

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user pynvim
```

When you have all the dependencies installed clone the repo in to
_~/.config/nvim/_

When you launch Neovim for the first time after cloning the repository you can
run _:MasonToolsInstall_ to install all needed Mason components for this
configuration.
